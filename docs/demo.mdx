## Optional fields

The default URL of your logo will be redirected to your base URL of your site. You can specify your own logo redirect URL. If the URL is an external link, it will open in a new tab.

###### Manually generate files

## Code blocks
### Inline code blocks
You can enclose the inline code in backticks (e.g., `Docuo`) 
```markdown
Add a `inline code block` in a sentence.
```

The rendered output looks like this:
Add a `inline code block` in a sentence.

### Single Code blocks
You can use fenced code blocks by enclosing code in three backticks.
````markdown
```
helloWorld();
```
````
The rendered output looks like this:
```markdown
helloWorld();
```

You can put the name of your programming language after the first three backticks to get syntax highlighting. Or you can indicate the lines to be highlighted in curly brackets.

````markdown
```jsx {1,4-6,11}
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  if (props.isBar) {
    return <div>Bar</div>;
  }

  return <div>Foo</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```
````
```jsx {1,4-6,11}
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  if (props.isBar) {
    return <div>Bar</div>;
  }

  return <div>Foo</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```




You can add more text after the programming language to set the name of your code example. The text can be anything as long as its all in one line.
````markdown
```javascript helloWorld.js
console.log("Hello World");
```
````
```javascript helloWorld.js
console.log("Hello World");
```



Code blocks show line numbers by default. If you want to hide line numbers, you can add `hideLineNumbers` at the end of the first three backticks.

````markdown
```jsx helloWorld.js {1,4-6,11} hideLineNumbers
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  if (props.isBar) {
    return <div>Bar</div>;
  }

  return <div>Foo</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```
````

```jsx helloWorld.js {1,4-6,11} hideLineNumbers
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  if (props.isBar) {
    return <div>Bar</div>;
  }

  return <div>Foo</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### Code groups

Use `<CodeGroup>` to aggregate multiple code blocks into one code group.

````markdown
<CodeGroup>
```javascript helloWorld.js
console.log("Hello World");
```

```python hello_world.py
print('Hello World!')
```

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
````



The rendered output looks like this:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript helloWorld.js
console.log("Hello World");
```

```python hello_world.py
print('Hello World!')
```

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
